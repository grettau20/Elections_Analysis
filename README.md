# Elections_Analysis

## Project Overview
Seth, a Colorado Board of Elections employee has ask for an election audit of a recent congressional election to be performed.

He requested that the information below be retrieved during the audit:
  1. Total number of votes casted.
  2. A list of candidate who received votes.
  3. Total number of votes for each candidate.
  4. Percentage of votes for each candidate won.
  5. Winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
## Resources
  - Data source: election_results.csv
  - Software: Python 3.10.7, vusual Studio Code 1.71

## Summary
The Analysis of the election results showed that:
  - There were 369711 votes casted in the election.
  - The candidates were:
      * Charles Casper Stockham
      * Diana DeGette
      * Raymon Anthony Doane
  - The candidate results were:
      * Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the votes and 85,213 number of votes.
      * Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 number of votes.
      * Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes and 11,606 number of votes.
  - The winner of the election was: 
      * Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 number of votes. 

## Challenge Overview

In addition to the candidate analysis, Seth has also requested that we retrieve the following information during the audit:

  - The County with the largest voter tournout using the county vote turnout and the
    percentage vote per county out of total.

## Challenge Summary

The additional analysis of the election results reveiled that 
  - The county with the largest voter turnout was 
      * Denver with 82.8% of the votes and 306,055 number of votes.


The final code output was as the image below:

We hope than Seth finds the information in this audit valuable and very helpful for his review of the recent congressional election results.

We also hope that the election commission finds the script developped to perfom this analysis useful as it can be apply to future congressional or similar elections to come. For example, the commission could modify the script to analyse the election in other states which means that county names would subsequently be modified to match the state. Another example, is that the commission could use the script for every election cycle and in this case, the candidate names would be modified to match the current election cycle.
